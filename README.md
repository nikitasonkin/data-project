## Data Science Project – Happiness and Health Analysis

## Overview
This project delves into the analysis of happiness and health indicators across various countries, aiming to uncover potential relationships between factors such as social support, corruption, life expectancy, GDP, and overall happiness. Utilizing diverse datasets, the project encompasses data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to derive meaningful insights.​

## Project Structure
- `FirstCSV.py: Processes and analyzes data from the first CSV file, focusing on initial data exploration.`
- `SecondCSV.py: Handles the second CSV file, performing similar exploratory analyses.`
- `Outer_JoinCSV.py: Merges the two datasets, conducts data cleaning, normalization, and prepares the data for further analysis.`
- `VizualizationOfData.py: Generates 13 unique graphs to visualize various aspects of the data, highlighting key insights.`
- `Clustering_df.py: Performs clustering on central indicators and applies linear regression to examine relationships between selected variables.`
- `input1_df.csv & input2_df.csv: The primary datasets used for analysis.`
- `View and insights.docx: A document summarizing the visualizations and the insights derived from them.​`

## Key Insights

- `The visualizations and analyses reveal several noteworthy patterns:​`
- `Correlation between GDP and Happiness: Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to report higher happiness scores.`
- `Impact of Social Support: Strong social support networks are associated with increased life satisfaction.`
- `Effect of Corruption: Lower levels of perceived corruption correlate with higher happiness levels.`
- `Life Expectancy Trends: Longer life expectancy is generally linked to greater happiness.​`
- `These insights are visualized through various graphs, including scatter plots, bar charts, and cluster diagrams, providing a comprehensive view of the data.​`

## Technologies Used
` Programming Language: Python`

## Libraries:
` Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis`
` NumPy: Numerical computations`
` Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization`
` Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms (clustering and regression)​`

## Getting Started
To replicate the analyses:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikitasonkin/data-project.git


2.Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd data-project
```

3.Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can use pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

4.Run the Scripts: Execute the Python scripts in the following order for a structured analysis:

`FirstCSV.py`
`SecondCSV.py`
`Outer_JoinCSV.py`
`VizualizationOfData.py`
`Clustering_df.py​`


## Future Enhancements
Interactive Dashboards: Integrate tools like Plotly Dash or Tableau for interactive data exploration.
Expanded Datasets: Incorporate additional datasets to broaden the scope of analysis.
Advanced Modeling: Apply more sophisticated machine learning models to predict happiness scores based on various indicators.​
